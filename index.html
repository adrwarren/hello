	<h1> Adrian Warren </h1>
	<p> 
		Hey there, I'm Adrian! I'm a second year student at the 
			<a href="https://ucsc.edu/" target = "_blank">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>!
		I'm majoring in Cognitive Science and 
			<a href="https://agpm.ucsc.edu/" target = "_blank">Art and Design: Games and Playable Media</a>! 
		I'm really interested in studying Human Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. 
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		I've made a few silly games here and there, including 
		<a href = "banana man win.jpeg" target = "_blank"><em>Banana Man VS the World</em></a> 
		with my friend Steph, but I'm currently in the process of making my own game from scratch! I'm excited about making something new for everyone to enjoy. The proposed "unofficial" release date is September 2023.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I enjoy coding in my free time; some languages I know are HTML5, CSS, JS, Java and Python! 
			<em>Currently learning C++</em>
